Beneath the stars, we whisper dreams,
In moonlight's glow, where magic gleams.
Through nightâ€™s embrace, our hearts take flight,
With every wish, in love's soft light.

The world may spin with trials and tears,
Yet here we find, our hopes and fears.
In quiet night, when all is still,
Our spirits soar, against the chill.

Together, we shall face the dawn,
With strength anew, till night is gone.
And though the journey may be long,
In unity, we find our song.
